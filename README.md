This simple app is based on the idea from this Scrimba training video:

The code is completely reworked, and I have added a data feed with multiple missions.

TODO:
- Use Moments or Luxon library to handle dates operations.

UPDATE (2024):
I have used this idea and redesigned the app using React. It now fetches the live data 
and displays the mission info for the next nine upcoming space launch events. 
It also boasts a mobile-first UI design.
